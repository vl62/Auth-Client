				<h4>A complete data discovery solution for diagnostic networks, disease consortia and research communities</h4>
				<p>We offer a complete data sharing software solution based upon enabling the 'open discovery' of data (rather than data 'sharing') for example, between networks of diagnostic laboratories or disease consortia that know/trust each other and share an interest in certain causative genes or diseases.</p>
				<p>We welcome any potential collaborations/partnerships with interested parties and would be particularly keen to hear from diagnostic networks and disease consortia. Please fill in the form to register your interest.</p>
