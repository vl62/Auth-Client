				<h3>Information for Gensearch Users</h3>
				<p>A key aim of Cafe Variome is to give clinical scientists the opportunity to share their data with the external community for mutual benefit. By publishing and sharing new variants, data will be brought to the attention of expert groups involved in curating locus-specific databases (LSDBs) for specific genetic diseases. This subsequently adds to the knowledge and understanding of these diseases by furthering scientific progress in the domain, ultimately benefitting all patients with inherited disorders.</p>
				<p>The process of submitting to Cafe Variome through the Gensearch software is intended to be as simple as possible, please use the following instructions in order to set up an account with Cafe Variome and subsequently submit from within Gensearch:</p>
